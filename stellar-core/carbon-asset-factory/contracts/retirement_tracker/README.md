The Retirement Tracker contract is CarbonScribe's finality layer for carbon offset usage. It retires credits by invoking burn logic on the carbon asset contract, then writes immutable retirement records for compliance, audit, and public proof.

## Key Capabilities

- Single and batch retirement flows
- Immutable retirement records per token id
- Entity-based retirement indexing for reporting
- Linked contract governance for upgradeable asset references
- Event emission for real-time compliance pipelines

## System Role

This contract finalizes offset lifecycle state:

1. Corporate or retiring entity authorizes retirement request.
2. Contract verifies token is not already retired.
3. Contract invokes carbon asset burn pathway.
4. Immutable retirement record is stored and indexed.
5. Event stream powers certificates, reporting, and transparency dashboards.

## Repository Structure

```text
retirement_tracker/
|- src/
|  \- lib.rs              # retirement logic, records, events, admin controls
|- tests/
|  \- ...                 # test scenarios
\- Cargo.toml
```

## Initialization Parameters

```rust
initialize(env, admin, carbon_asset_contract)
```

- `admin`: authority for linked contract updates
- `carbon_asset_contract`: active carbon asset contract used for burn calls

## Public Interface

### Retirement Execution

```rust
retire(env, token_id, retiring_entity, reason)
batch_retire(env, token_ids, retiring_entity, reason)
```

- `retire`: executes one retirement and returns the created record
- `batch_retire`: attempts each token and returns only successful retirements

### Ledger Queries

```rust
is_retired(env, token_id)
get_retirement_record(env, token_id)
get_retirements_by_entity(env, retiring_entity)
```

### Admin Controls

```rust
update_carbon_asset_contract(env, caller, new_contract)
get_admin(env)
get_carbon_asset_contract(env)
```

## Retirement Record Model

Each `RetirementRecord` stores:

- token id
- retiring entity address
- ledger timestamp
- derived transaction hash
- optional reason string for reporting context

This schema supports corporate disclosures, anti-double-counting checks, and public retirement proof.

## Build and Test

```bash
cd contracts/retirement_tracker
cargo test
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

## Testnet Deployment

```bash
cd contracts/retirement_tracker
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/retirement_tracker.wasm \
  --source <IDENTITY_NAME> \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

Then call `initialize` with the deployed carbon asset contract address before retirement operations.

## Security Notes

- Retiring entity authentication is mandatory for retirement calls.
- Duplicate retirement is blocked by immutable ledger key checks.
- Admin-only linked contract updates reduce unauthorized redirection risk.
- Burn invocation plus retirement record write keeps retirement flow auditable.
